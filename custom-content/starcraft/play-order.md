Below is a **maximum playable chronological order** that aims to **feel coherent as a story**, while openly mixing **canon, semi-canon, and high-quality fan campaigns**. I’ve grouped things so the political situation and character arcs still make sense as you play.



---

## 1. Early Koprulu unrest (pre–SC1)

These fit best as *background chaos* before Mengsk’s rebellion fully ignites.

1. **Precursor** [F]
2. **Operation: Silent Scream** [F]
3. **Mercenaries 1** [F]
4. **Deception** [F]

> *Tone-wise*: fragmented Terran conflicts, early Zerg/Protoss rumors.

---

## 2. The eve of rebellion

5. **Loomings** (SC Demo, 1998) [S]
   *Direct narrative lead-in to Rebel Yell.*

---

## 3. The Great War (StarCraft)

6. **Terran Campaign — Rebel Yell** [C]

7. **Enslavers** (1998) [S]
   *Fits cleanly after Rebel Yell as a shadow conflict.*

8. **Resurrection IV** [F]
   *Works well here as fallout from Terran/Zerg chaos.*

9. **Mercenaries 2** [F]

10. **Zerg Campaign — The Overmind** [C]

11. **Retribution (Terran / Protoss / Zerg)** [F]
    *A nice bridge showing multi-faction instability.*

12. **Protoss Campaign — The Fall** [C]

---

## 4. Aftermath of the Great War (pre–Brood War)

13. **Insurrection** (1999) [S]
    *Occurs after SC1, before Brood War; politically messy but fits.*

> ⚠️ **Antioch Chronicles** [F – AU]
> Optional only. Place **here** *if* you want it, but treat it as an alternate timeline.
> It contradicts core Protoss lore.

---

## 5. The Brood War

14. **Protoss Campaign — The Stand** [C]
15. **Terran Campaign — The Iron Fist** [C]
16. **Zerg Campaign — Queen of Blades** [C]

---

## 6. Post–Brood War epilogues

17. **Enslavers II: Dark Vengeance** (1998) [S]
    *Best post-BW side story; doesn’t break canon.*

18. **Stukov Missions** [F]
    *Excellent emotional epilogue if you accept expanded lore.*
