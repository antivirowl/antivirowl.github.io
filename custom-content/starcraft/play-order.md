Below is a **maximum playable chronological order** that aims to **feel coherent as a story**, while openly mixing **canon, semi-canon, and high-quality fan campaigns**. I’ve grouped things so the political situation and character arcs still make sense as you play.

---

## 0. PROLOGUE ERA (Non-canon / legacy lore)

1. **Precursor (1999)**

   * Ancient Protoss/Xel’Naga-style setup
   * Not canon, but fine as a “mythic prologue”

---

## 1. Early Koprulu unrest (pre–SC1)

These fit best as *background chaos* before Mengsk’s rebellion fully ignites.

2. **Loomings (1998)**
3. **Operation: Silent Scream**
4. **Mercenaries 1**
5. **Deception**

> These generally work as early, small-scale Terran conflicts before Mengsk’s rebellion explodes.

> *Tone-wise*: fragmented Terran conflicts, early Zerg/Protoss rumors.

---

## 2. The Great War (StarCraft)

6. **Terran Campaign — Rebel Yell**
   *(StarCraft)*

---

### MID-GREAT WAR (Fan content that fits *during* SC1)

7. **Insurrection**

   * Despite often being labeled “prequel,” it **assumes Mengsk’s rise**
   * Best placed **mid–Rebel Yell or immediately after it**

8. **Enslavers Scenario (1998)**

   * Blizzard-authored, semi-canon
   * Occurs **after Rebel Yell, before Zerg campaign**

9. **Retribution (terran/protoss/zerg)**

   * Fits best here if you’re including it at all

---

### THE OVERMIND’S WAR (CANON CORE)

10. **Zerg Campaign — The Overmind**
11. **Protoss Campaign — The Fall**

---

## 3. Aftermath of the Great War (pre–Brood War)

12. **Resurrection IV**
13. **Mercenaries 2**

> These generally assume:
>
> * Aiur has fallen
> * Kerrigan is active
> * Dominion exists

> ⚠️ **Antioch Chronicles** [F – AU]
> Optional only. Place **here** *if* you want it, but treat it as an alternate timeline.

* Written **before Brood War lore stabilized**
* Contradicts:

  * Kerrigan’s role
  * Protoss politics
  * Post-Aiur continuity

---

## 4. The Brood War

14. **Protoss Campaign — The Stand**
15. **Terran Campaign — The Iron Fist**
16. **Zerg Campaign — Queen of Blades**

---

## 6. Post–Brood War epilogues


17. **Enslavers II: Dark Vengeance (1998)**

* Explicitly **post–Brood War**
* Stukov, UED remnants, Dominion aftermath

18. **Stukov Missions**

* Very late timeline placement
* Almost a bridge toward SC2-era thinking
