<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High above, half-hidden among dripping leaves, a bandit scout crouched motionless. Rain slid from his hood as he watched the procession pass beneath him. His eyes narrowed when he caught sight of the crest upon the carriage.
<br><br>Hourne.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scout withdrew without a sound, slipping from the branches and signaling ahead.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest gradually thinned. Trees gave way to open ground where wind and rain struck unobstructed. Ahead, stone rose sharply on either side as the road narrowed into a rocky mountain pass—barren, exposed, offering little cover.
            
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rain fell harder now, striking stone and armor alike, drumming against steel and leather as both sides faced one another, motionless but poised to strike.

            <p>Thunder rolled low across the sky as rain filtered through the dense forest canopy, falling in uneven sheets upon the winding road. This stretch of woodland marked the uneasy threshold between Hourne and Leonis territory.</p>

             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mud clung to the wheels of a modest carriage as it advanced at a careful pace, escorted by a small contingent of unarmed soldiers. At their head rode Schuzelt, his greatsword secured across his back like a promise of violence yet unfulfilled. His gaze moved constantly— the rise and fall of the path ahead, the underbrush, the tree line. The trees leaned inward; to obscure? or to pry? 
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soldiers riding alongside the carriage wore light armor, for mobility more so than protection, with light ceremonial flare. Within the carriage, Lady Machérie sat upright, hands folded atop her staff. Her expression was composed, her gaze steady despite the isolation of the road ahead.
<br><br>The air was still. Heavy, with ill intent.<br>
And Schuzelt did not like this road.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High above, half-hidden among dripping leaves, a bandit scout crouched motionless. Rain slid from his hood as he watched the procession pass beneath him. His eyes narrowed when he caught sight of the crest upon the carriage.
