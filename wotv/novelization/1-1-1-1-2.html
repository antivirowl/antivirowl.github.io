The air was still. <br>Heavy, with ill intent.<br>
And Schuzelt did not like this road.
            <span style="display: block; line-height: 9px;"><br></span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High above, half-hidden among dripping leaves, a bandit scout crouched motionless. Rain slid from his hood as he watched the procession pass beneath him. His eyes narrowed when he caught sight of the crest upon the carriage.
            <span style="display: block; line-height: 9px;"><br></span>
Hourne.
            <span style="display: block; line-height: 9px;"><br></span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scout withdrew without a sound, slipping from the branches and signaling ahead.
            <span style="display: block; line-height: 9px;"><br></span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forest gradually thinned. Trees gave way to open ground where wind and rain struck unobstructed. Ahead, stone rose sharply on either side as the road narrowed into a rocky mountain pass—barren, exposed, offering little cover.
            
            <span style="display: block; line-height: 9px;"><br></span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rain fell harder now, striking stone and armor alike, drumming against steel and leather as both sides faced one another, motionless but poised to strike.
            <span style="display: block; line-height: 9px;"><br></span>
From within the carriage came Machérie’s calm voice.
<br><i>“Is something the matter, Schuzelt?”</i>
            <span style="display: block; line-height: 9px;"><br></span>
            He did not turn. <br>
Rain slid along the edge of his blade as he answered.<br>
<i>“Worry not. I shall handle these ruffians in short order.”</i>

A pause followed. <br>For a moment, <br>even the rain seemed to soften.<br>
<i>“I do so miss our castle,”</i> <br>Machérie said quietly.
            <span style="display: block; line-height: 9px;"><br></span>
            <i>“Princess…”</i> <br>His tone carried warning more than reproach.
            <span style="display: block; line-height: 9px;"><br></span>
<i>“I know. <br>It’s for the good of the kingdom,”</i> <br>she replied.
            <span style="display: block; line-height: 9px;"><br></span>
<i>“My sympathies, my lady.”</i>i>
            <span style="display: block; line-height: 9px;"><br></span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She hesitated before speaking again, <i>“If only I’d been born a man, then I could rush headlong into battle with you,”</i> her voice touched with longing.
